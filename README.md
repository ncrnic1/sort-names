# sort-names Overview

This program takes in a list of names and sorts them by alphabetical order; last name and then first name.  
Then, it creates a file containing the sorted order.  

# Installation

Download, and extract wherever you would like.  

# Dependencies

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.0.1 recommended, if wanting to compile and run via command prompt.  
For javac and java to work correctly, the JDK also may need to be configured manually.
